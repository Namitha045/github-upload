        <p>Derived from the Sanskrit word 'Saatikaa' which means 'strip of cloth', it has now evolved to 'Sari'
          in modern Indian languages. There are more than 80 recorded ways to wear a Sari. To turn a yarn of cotton into
          a beautiful piece of art, Weavers spend days and sometimes months to bring you something which is much more
          than what meets the eye. More than 4 million weavers, showcasing impeccable skills and expertise to the world.
          Let us salute these heroes who help maintain the rich culture and heritage of our Country.</p>
